# py-fractals
Some python scripts to build awesome fractals

!! All three files will require the Pillow library for Python !!

In this repository, you can find three files with functions that allow you to draw awesome fractals.

The first one draws the Mandelbrot set in grey shades with the mandelbrot() function. You can use the commented section in this file to put colours on the image instead of grey shades.

The second file contains the julia(a,b) function, that will draw the Julia set in grey shades for the a+bi complex point.

The third file will draw the Barnsley fern fractal with the barnsley_fern() function, with a beautiful green colour.
